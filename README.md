# Shelter - Frontend Course Project

Welcome to Shelter, a frontend project developed as part of my educational journey in frontend web development courses. Shelter is a responsive web application built according to a design layout, aimed at showcasing my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project faithfully follows the design mockup, providing a user-friendly and visually appealing interface.

## Features:

- Responsive design for various screen sizes.
- Implementing interactive elements using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Smooth navigation and intuitive user experience.

For a glimpse of the design mockup that inspired Shelter, please check out the [Design Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/Yk6EnbY63FyG2PJTFkJDMh/shelter?type=design&node-id=94-43&mode=design&t=SMP0FK40SfcspeVG-0).
